### Tenses 1

How unfamiliar a language like Lojban must seem to an English-speaker, when one can read through eleven lessons of Lojban grammar without meeting a tense once!
This is because, unlike many natural languages (most Indo-European ones, for instance), all tenses in Lojban are optional.
Saying _mi tavla do_ can mean "I talk to you" or "I talked to you" or "I always talk to you" or "In a moment, I will have just finished talking to you", among other possibilities.
Context resolves what is correct, and in most conversation, tenses are not needed at all.
However, when it's needed it's needed, and it must be taught.
Furthermore, Lojban tenses are unusual because they treat time and space fundamentally the same &ndash; saying that I worked a long time ago is not grammatically different than saying I work far away to the north.

Like many other languages, the Lojban tense system is perhaps the most difficult part of the language.
Unlike many other languages though, it's perfectly regular and makes sense.
So fear not, for it will not involve sweating to learn how to modify the selbri or anything silly like that.

No, in the Lojban tense system, all tenses are sumtcita, which we have conveniently just made ourselves familiar with.
Okay okay, technically, tenses are slightly different from other sumtcita, but this difference is almost insignificant, and won't be explained until later.
In most aspects they are like all other sumtcita.
<!--In most aspects they are like all other sumtcita; they are terminated by ku, just like **BAI**.-->

There are many different kinds of tense-sumtcita, so let's start at the ones most familiar to English-speakers.

<span class="definition-head">pu</span> sumtcita: before SUMTI.

<span class="definition-head">ca</span> sumtcita: at the same time as SUMTI.

<span class="definition-head">ba</span> sumtcita: after SUMTI.

These are like the English concepts before, now and after.
In actuality though, one could argue that two point-like events can never occur exactly simultaneously, rendering _ca_ useless.
But _ca_ extends slightly into the past and the future, meaning "just about now".
This is because human beings don't perceive time in a perfectly logical way, and the Lojban tense system reflects that.

Let's look at a few examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi pu dunda lo mlatu|<span class="spoiler-answer">I donated the cat.</span>|
|ca ku mi vecnu lo skami|<span class="spoiler-answer">I am selling the computer.</span>|
|mi ba gleki|<span class="spoiler-answer">I will be happy.</span>|
|mi tavla lo ba ctuca|<span class="spoiler-answer">I am talking (or have talked or will talk) to the future teacher.</span>|

Usually when speaking, we do not need to specify which event in the past this action is relative to.
In "I donated the cat", we can assume that the action happened relative to now, and thus we can elide the sumti of the sumtcita, because it's obvious.
In the second example, "I am selling my computer", we did the same thing, albeit with slightly different syntax.
Recall that there are two ways to leave the sumti of sumtcita unspecified: either put it before the selbri, or terminate it with _ku_.

In these cases, the sumti which fills the sumtcita is an implied _zo'e_, which is almost always understood as relative to the speaker's time and place (this is especially important when speaking about left and right).
If speaking about some events that happened some other time than the present, it is sometimes assumed that all tenses are relative to that event which is being spoken about.
In order to clarify that all tenses are relative to the speaker's current position, the word _nau_ can be used at any time.
Another word, _ki_, marks a tense which is then considered the new standard.
Don't worry, there is no need to memorize these words right now.
They will be taught much later.

Of course, it is also possible to specify the sumti of the sumtcita explicitly.
This makes it possible to specify a temporal (or spacial) relation between two events.
Here are a few examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi dunda lo mlatu ba lo nu vecnu lo plise {kei} {ku}|<span class="spoiler-answer">I donated (or am donating or will donate) the cat after selling the apple.</span>|
|mi vecnu lo skami ca lo nu tavla do {kei} {ku}|<span class="spoiler-answer">I sold (or am selling or will sell) the computer while talking to you.</span>|

Note that, in the first example, it is not clear whether the cat has been already donated, or even whether the apple has already been sold.
We are just establishing a temporal relationship between "donating the cat" and "selling the apple", without specifying where they are positioned relative to now.
The same applies principle to the second example as well.

<!--Side note: It was actually suggested making the Lojban tense system relativistic. That idea, however, was dropped, because it is counter-intuitive, and would mean that to learn Lojban, one would have to learn the theory of relativity first.-->
