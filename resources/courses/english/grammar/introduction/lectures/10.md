### Linked sumti

Let's start this lesson with two new words:

<span class="definition-head">bangu</span> x_1 is a/the language/dialect used by x_2 to express/communicate x_3 (si'o/du'u, not quote).

<span class="definition-head">cmene</span> x_1 (quoted word(s)) is a/the name/title/tag of x_2 to/used-by namer/name-user x_3 (person).

What if I wanted to say "my language", or "my name"?

You can probably see that the sumti _lo bangu ku poi mi se bangu ke'a {kei} {ku}_ is a less than elegant expression for "my language".
This is because it's really a workaround.
A language which I speak can be said to fill into the x_1 of the bridi _bangu mi_.
But we can't convert that to a sumti using just **lo**..**ku**, as in _lo bangu mi ku_.
The reason is that _lo_ only accepts selbri, and _bangu mi_ is a bridi, not a selbri.
Hence _lo bangu {ku} mi_ is actually two separate sumti, _lo bangu ku_ and _mi_.

What about **lo su'u**..**kei ku**?
We can't use that either, because the _su'u_ gives the bridi a new x_1, the abstraction, and the _lo_ then extracts that.
Hence _lo su'u {zo'e} bangu mi {kei} {ku}_ is an abstraction sumti meaning something like "that something is my language".

Enter _be_. _be_ is a word which binds constructs (sumti as well as others we'll later see) to a selbri.
Using it in ordinary selbri has no effect: in _mi nelci be do_, the _be_ does nothing.
However, when a sumti is bound to a selbri this way, you can use **lo**..**ku** on the selbri without the sumti splitting off: _lo bangu be mi {ku}_ is a correct solution to the problem above.
<!-- Likewise, you can attach a sumtcita: lo jinga be gau do: The one who wins because of you. -->

Let's see some examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi nelci lo cmene be do|I like your name.</span>|
|xu lo prenu cu tavla fo lo bangu be do|Is the person talking in your language?</span>|
|mi tavla fi lo se nupre be do|I talked about your promise.</span>|

What if I want to attach several sumti to a selbri inside **lo**..**ku**?
"The giver of the apple to you" is _lo dunda be lo plise be do_, right?
Nope.
The second _be_ attaches to the apple, meaning _lo plise be do_ &ndash; "the apple of the strain of you", which makes no sense.
In order to string several sumti to a selbri, all the ones following the first must be bound with _bei_.
The binding can be terminated with _be'o_ &ndash; one instance of _be'o_ for each selbri which has sumti bound by _be_.

Here are the definitions:

<span class="definition-head">be</span> binds sumti or sumtcita to selbri.

<span class="definition-head">bei</span> binds a second, third, fourth (etc) sumti or sumtcita to a selbri.

<span class="definition-head">be'o</span> ends binding to selbri.

And a few more examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi pendo lo pilno be lo skami bei lo nu ctuca|I am a friend of the user of computers for teaching.|
|mi tavla fi lo se nupre be do bei lo ctuca|I talked about the promise you made to the teacher.|
|mi tavla lo sutra be lo nu vecnu|I talked to the (one who is) fast in selling.|

Note that the last sentence could have been written more concisely as a tanru, with almost zero precision loss: _mi tavla lo sutra vecnu_.
<!-- In lojban, ... -->


### Exercises

<!-- TODO: write some sentences -->
<!-- do do -->
Now it's your turn.
Translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi nelci lo pendo be do|<span class="spoiler-answer">I like your friend.</span>|
|lo vecnu be lo skami cu pendo|<span class="spoiler-answer">The seller of computers is friendly.</span>|
|mi ciska lo cmene be lo pilno be lo skami|<span class="spoiler-answer">I wrote the name of the user of computers.</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|My friend likes sellers of apples.|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo pendo be mi cu nelci lo vecnu be lo plise</span>|
|Did you write your friend's promise?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu do ciska lo se nupre be lo pendo be do</span>| <!-- Is this translation acceptable? -->
|I like your teaching method.|<span class="spoiler-answer">mi nelci lo xe ctuca be fu do</span>|
