### Tenses 3

As previously mentioned, Lojban tenses treat time and space fundamentally the same &ndash; saying that I worked a long time ago is not grammatically different than saying I work far away to the north.
Let's meet a few spacial tenses:

<span class="definition-head">zu'a</span> sumtcita: left of SUMTI.

<span class="definition-head">ri'u</span> sumtcita: right of SUMTI.

<span class="definition-head">ca'u</span> sumtcita: in front of SUMTI.

<span class="definition-head">bu'u</span> sumtcita: at the same place as SUMTI (spacial equivalent of ca).

Now, let's see a few examples of their usage:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|zu'a do tavla lo prenu|To the left of you, (somebody) is talking to a person.|
|zu'a ku do tavla lo prenu|To the left, you are talking to a person.|
|do zu'a {ku} ctuca|To the left, you are teaching.|
|ri'u lo ctuca lo mi pendo cu ciska|To the right of the instructor, my friend is writing.|
|ca'u lo skami lo vecnu cu tavla lo te vecnu|In front of the computer, the seller is talking to the buyer.|
|bu'u lo zdani mi gleki|At home, I am happy.|
|bu'u ma do gleki|Where are you happy?|

Also, if spacial and temporal tenses are mixed, the rule is to always put temporal before spacial.
Here are a few examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi ba {ku} zu'a {ku} ctuca|I will teach to the left.|
|ba {ku} ri'u lo ctuca lo mi pendo cu ciska|To the right of the instructor, my friend will write.|
|mi pu {ku} gleki bu'u lo zdani|At home, I was happy.|

Pretty, intuitive, right?

But what if we wanted to say that something happened shortly to the left, or will happen far into the future?
Luckily, Lojban has words for that, too.

<span class="definition-head">vi</span> location tense distance: here at ... ; at or a very short/tiny distance from ...

<span class="definition-head">va</span> location tense distance: near to ... ; there at ...; a medium/small distance from ...

<span class="definition-head">vu</span> location tense distance: far from ... ; yonder at ... ; a long distance from ...

<span class="definition-head">zi</span> time tense distance: instantaneous-to-short distance in time

<span class="definition-head">za</span> time tense distance: medium distance in time

<span class="definition-head">zu</span> time tense distance: long distance in time

Notice the vowel order _i_, _a_ and _u_.
This order appears again and again in Lojban, and might be worth memorizing.
Short and long are always context dependent, relative and subjective.
Two hundred years is a short time for a species to evolve, but a very long time to wait for the bus.

Let's see a few examples:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|mi pu {ku} zu {ku} gleki bu'u lo zdani|A long time ago, I was happy at home.|
|do vu {ku} gleki|Far away, you will be happy.|
|lo gerku pu {ku} zi {ku} gleki|Shortly ago, the dog was happy.|
|mi ba {ku} zu'a {ku} vi {ku} ctuca|I will teach shortly to the left.|
|lo va mlatu cu melbi|The moderately distant cat is beautiful.|

<!-- TODO: teach in next lesson about tenses, "Tenses 4" -->
<!--The order in which direction-sumtcita and distance-sumtcita are said makes a difference.-->
<!--The meaning of several tense words placed together is pictured by an imaginary journey reading from left to right.-->
<!--Thus _pu zu_ is a long time ago while zu pu is in the past of some point in time which is a long time toward the future or the past of now. In the first example, pu shows that we begin in the past, zu then that it is a long time backwards. In the second example, zu shows that we begin at some point far away in time from now, pu then, that we move backwards from that point. Thus pu zu is always in the past. zu pu could be in the future. The fact that these time tenses combine in this way is one of the differences between tense sumtcita and other sumtcita. The meanings of other sumtcita are not altered by the presence of additional sumtcita in a bridi.-->

**Note:** People rarely use _zi_, _za_ or _zu_ without a _pu_ or _ba_ in front of it.
This is because most people always need to specify past or future in their native language. When you think about it Lojbanically, most of the time the time-direction is obvious, and the _pu_ or _ba_ is superfluous!

It is also possible to say that something happened two meters to the left, or will happen three days into the future; but this will only be covered in a future lesson.

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button nearby!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
