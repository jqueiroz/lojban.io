### Questions

Questions in Lojban are very easy to learn, and they come in two kinds: fill in the blank, and true/false questions.
Let's begin with the true-false question kind &ndash; that's pretty overcomeable, since it only involves one word, _xu_.

#### True/false questions
The word _xu_ transforms the whole sentence into a question, asking whether it is true or not.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|xu do dunda lo zdani ku|Did you donate the house?|
|xu do nelci lo gerku ku|Do you like dogs?|
|xu do tavla lo ctuca ku|Did you talk to the instructor?|

In the previous sentences, _xu_ was placed right at the beginning.
But this is not required: _xu_ may go anywhere in a sentence, and it gives emphasis to the preceding word (or construct).
When placed right at the beginning of a sentence, it is understood to come right after _.i_.
And since _.i_ is responsible for initiating the sentence, emphasis goes to the whole sentence (or, alternatively, to nowhere in particular).

|Sentence|Possible translation|Emphasis|
|--------|------|------|
|.i xu do dunda lo zdani ku|Did you donate the house?|no particular emphasis|
|xu do dunda lo zdani ku|Did you donate the house?|no particular emphasis|
|do xu dunda lo zdani ku|Did **you** donate the house?|emphasis on "you" &ndash; was it really you, and not someone else?|
|do dunda xu lo zdani ku|Did you **donate** the house?|emphasis on "donate" &ndash; did you really donate the house, instead of doing something else with it? Like... selling it?|
|do dunda lo xu zdani ku|Did you donate **the house**?|emphasis on "the house" &ndash; was it really the house, and not something else?|
|do dunda lo zdani ku xu|Did you donate **the house**?|emphasis on "the house" &ndash; was it really the house, and not something else?|

To answer a true/false question, you just repeat the selbri (possibly negated).

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|dunda|donated &ndash; Yes, I donated the house.|
|na dunda|not donated &ndash; No, I did not donate the house.|

Negation is a complex subject, and we will learn more about it in a future lesson.
For now, just stick with _na_, which roughly means "It is not true that (...)".

<span class="definition-head">na</span> bridi contradictory negator; scope is an entire bridi.

Also, there is another way of answering a true/false question, which is to use the word _go'i_.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|go'i|donated &ndash; Yes, I donated the house.|
|na go'i|not donated &ndash; No, I did not donate the house.|

The word _go'i_ just repeats the previous bridi, and hence these two approaches that we saw are equivalent.

<span class="definition-head">go'i</span> pro-bridi: preceding bridi; in answer to a yes/no question, repeats the claim, meaning yes.

#### Fill in the blank questions

The other kind of question is "fill in the blank".
Here, you ask for the question word to be replaced with a construct that would make the bridi correct.
There are several of these words, depending on what you are asking about.
The most frequently used are _ma_, for sumti questions, and _mo_, for selbri questions.

To ask about a sumti, you just place the question word _ma_ where you want your answer.
For example, _do dunda ma mi_ asks the listener to reply with the sumti that would correctly fill the x_2, that is, the gift.

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|do dunda ma mi|What did you give to me?|
|do ctuca fi ma|What did you teach?|
|do tavla fo ma|What language are you talking in?|

Similarly, to ask about a selbri, you just place the question word _mo_ where you want your answer.
For example, _do mo_ means "What are you doing?" (or "What/Who are you?"), to which one could reply _tavla_ ("I am talking"), or _prenu_ ("I am a person").

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|------|
|do mo|What are you doing? / What are you?|
|mi mo do|What did I do to you?|
|do mi mo|What are you doing to me?|


#### Remark

Since tone of voice or sentence structure does not reveal whether a sentence is a question or not, one better not miss the question word.
Therefore, since people tend to focus more on words in the beginning or at the end of sentences, it's usually worthwhile to re-order the sentence so that the question words are at those places.

<!--
If that is not feasable, pau is an attitudinal marking that the sentence is a question. Contrary, pau nai explicitly marks any question as being rhetorical.
While we are on the topic of questions, it's also appropriate to mention the word kau, which is a marker for indirect question. What's an indirect question, then? Well, take a look at the sentence: mi djuno lo du'u ma kau zdani do - I know what is your home.
-->

#### Exercises

It's now time for you to attempt a few more translations.
You will need the following new word:

<span class="definition-head">djuno</span> x_1 knows fact(s) x_2 are true about x_3 by epistemology x_4.

Translate the following sentences from Lojban into English:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|do ciska ma|<span class="spoiler-answer">What did you write?</span>|
|do djuno fi lo mlatu ku xu|<span class="spoiler-answer">Do you know about **cats**?</span>|
|ma ciska fi ta|<span class="spoiler-answer">Who wrote there?</span>|
|lo gerku ku mo do|<span class="spoiler-answer">What did the dog do to you?</span>|

Now, translate the following sentences from English into Lojban:

|Sentence|Possible translation|
|--------|-----------|
|Who likes cats?|<span class="spoiler-answer">ma nelci lo mlatu ku</span>|
|What is the scribe doing?|<span class="spoiler-answer">lo ciska ku mo</span>|
|What do you know about dogs?|<span class="spoiler-answer">do djuno ma lo gerku ku</span>|
|Is the instructor writing?|<span class="spoiler-answer">xu lo ctuca ku ciska</span>|

### Practice

As usual, before proceeding to the next lesson, get some practice with interactive exercises &ndash; look for the "Practice" button near the top of the page!

Beware that exercises loop indefinitely, so feel free to stop once you feel you've had enough.
And be sure to revisit exercises on different days, to benefit from the spacing effect.
