### Lesson plan

* Lesson
  * Brief overview of the language, including history and motivation
    * Monoparsing and parse trees
      * Syntactical unambiguity vs adjustable degree of semantic precision/vagueness
    * Simplicity and extensibility
  * High-level morphology and phonology
    * Mention that phonology is the same as for lojban
  * Particles vs roots
    * Explain the concept of families (i.e. the grammatical equivalence of all words within a family)
  * Predicates as the building block of the language
    * Explain the view of predicates as proposition templates
    * Each predicate may have up to four places: E, A, O, U (and this vowel pattern is common in eberban)
    * Consider showing a table with the meaning of Xd and other place types, but mention to the reader that they don't need to worry about that right now
  * Connecting predicates with VE (ve/va/vo/vu)
    * Initially, always specify the VE connective
    * In this lesson, only show how to connect two predicates (not more)
    * "ve binds together the first place from each of the predicates"
* Vocabulary
  * Some roots (e.g. house), some discursives (me/you, this/that)
* New exercises
  * Translations from English to Eberban
  * Given a sentence, tell its place structure
      * Example: "Select the listener"
